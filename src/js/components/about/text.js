Nigeria is blessed with rich proverbs that span the numerous tribes and ethnic groups that she can boast of. However it hurts to know that this knowledge is lacking amongst our youth. Many thanks to the introduction of civilization. What must be done? It is thus our duty to <strong>BRING BACK OUR WISDOM</strong>."

      desc: "When brillant minds meet, one can only imagine what the result would be. Such was the case in the past, when our ancestors controlled the affiars of their environment. They pondered on and about nature, conversed with her mother, churrnned out beatifule pieces of wisdom, in writing, but more in words. \"Where have these pieces gone to?\", One may ask. The answer is yet to be discovered."
